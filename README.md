# Features

1. **uYou:** uYou has a ton of features that I can't list them all. Visit [here](https://miro92.com/repo/depictions/?p=com.miro.uyou) for more info!

2. **iSponsorBlock:** Skips annoying sponsor ads inside videos. iSponsorBlock is based on [SponsorBlock engine](https://sponsor.ajay.app/). Basically, this is the iOS version of the SponsorBlock extension.

3. **YouPiP:** enable YouTube's **native PiP**. More options are in YouTube Settings => General.

4. **YTUHD:** unlock VP9 codec and in effect, enables video quality of 2K and 4K. You can enable/disable YTUHD in YouTube Settings => Video quality preferences.

<details>
  <summary>And more...!</summary>

5. **YTClassicVideoQuality:** since YouTube v16.xx, you need one more step to change the video quality. YTClassicVideoQuality brings back the old video quality selector, which is a lot better than the new one.

6. **YTNoHoverCards:** offer an option to enable/disable the annoying suggested videos show up at the end of the videos.

7. **YTSystemAppearance**: sync the YouTube theme (dark/light) with the system theme.

8. **YTNoCheckLocalNetwork**: block the Local Network permission popup.

9. **YouRememberCaption**: make YouTube remember your video caption setting (if not already).

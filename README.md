# Features

1. **uYou:** uYou has a ton of features that I can't list them all. Visit his [here](https://miro92.com/repo/depictions/?p=com.miro.uyou) for more info!

2. **iSponsorBlock:** Skips annoying sponsor ads inside videos. iSponsorBlock is based on [SponsorBlock engine](https://sponsor.ajay.app/). This is the iOS version of the SponsorBlock extension.

3. **YouRememberCaption**: make YouTube remember your video caption setting (if not already).

4. **YTClassicVideoQuality:** since YouTube v16.xx, you need one more step to change the video quality. YTClassicVideoQuality brings back the old video quality selector, which is a lot better than the new one.

5. **YTNoCheckLocalNetwork**: block the Local Network permission popup.

6. **YTNoHoverCards:** offer an option to enable/disable the annoying suggested videos show up at the end of the videos.

7. **YTSystemAppearance**: sync the YouTube theme (dark/light) with the system theme.

8. **YTUHD:** unlock VP9 codec and in effect, enables video quality of 2K and 4K. You can enable/disable YTUHD in YouTube Settings => Video quality preferences.

9. **YouPiP:** enable YouTube's **native PiP**. More options are in YouTube Settings => General.


# Known issues 

1. **uYou**: all known-issues of uYou are listed [here](https://github.com/MiRO92/uYou-for-YouTube/issues). Make sure you take a look at it before reporting any bugs! ***Also, keep in mind that uYou+ is a modified version of uYou, DO NOT bother MiRO92 with problems unrelated to uYou!!!***

3. **iSponsorBlock**: the modified time doesn't show up in the seek bar.

3. **YTUHD**: Stuttering on 4K videos (sometimes).

4. **YouPiP** (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the *speedup-bug* as described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKdv1fr_KRWgD8nhkMDfG2eLBnbdeVtX/view?usp=sharing). The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable **Legacy PiP** is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou. Use it at your own risk.

5. **Not a bug**: 

> - The app won't be able to receive push notifications if you use a free developer account to sideload it. 
>
> - appdb PRO users: follow [**this guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/comments/pub39h/guide_how_to_fix_uyouuyou_download_not_working/) to fix uYou download not working.
>
> - It's impossible to fix deep-link (a.k.a Open in the YouTube app). However, you can use this [Shortcuts](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/open-in-youtube/) as a workaround (tested on iOS 14). **Credit:** RandomAccessMemories#5025

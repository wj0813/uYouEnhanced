Failure to adhere to this rule may result in legal action being taken by either the tweak developer or Google, as .ipa files are strictly prohibited. I apologize for any inconvenience, but it is essential to maintain the uYouEnhanced repository.
**Simplified Version:** When building the ipa from your forked repository of uYouEnhanced, do not upload, publish, or distribute any .ipa files under any circumstances. Violation of this rule may lead to immediate action to have the content removed.

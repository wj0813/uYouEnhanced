# Code of Conduct for This Repostory
If I verify a reported Code of Conduct violation, my policy is:

- Contributors are allowed to make patches only to the main branch, unless an additional branch is involved. This policy applies to the implementation of custom features/options, updated features/options, and grammar errors.

- The use of the name `uYouPlusExtra` is prohibited. The correct and updated name for this repository is `uYouEnhanced`.
  - if there is a tweak named or have the description of the word `uYouPlusExtra` then please do check it out before you interact with it or use it.

- Users who fork this repository, utilize it in actions, or build it from the repository on Git are strictly prohibited from releasing .ipa files in any form on their forked repositories. This restriction is in place to comply with the terms outlined in the following link: https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/attachments/token/1u4kyYJnjA8HZTPMXOGBhRk4Q/?. Failure to adhere to this rule may result in legal action being taken by either the tweak developer or Google, as .ipa files are strictly prohibited. I apologize for any inconvenience, but it is essential to maintain the uYouEnhanced repository.
**Simplified Version:** When building the ipa from your forked repository of uYouEnhanced, do not upload, publish, or distribute any .ipa files under any circumstances. Violation of this rule may lead to immediate action to have the content removed.

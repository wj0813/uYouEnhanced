- How to translate uYouPlus (if your language already exists then feel free to check it and/or improve it):
1. Fork uYouPlus repo
2. Duplicate the template.lproj folder, and edit the duplicated folder's name to your <lang_code>.lproj id.
For example: <ru.lproj> for Russia. For more details, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
3. Translate each line below after each =
4. Open a Pull Request

- You can also add your localization to YouPiP, YTUHD and Return YouTube Dislike. The process is the same:
